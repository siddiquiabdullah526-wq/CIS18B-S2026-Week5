# Mini-Assignment 6: Custom Iterable and Iterator Pattern

## Objective
Implement a custom `Iterable` domain model and compare multiple iterator strategies.

## Primary Competency
Custom `Iterable` design and iterator strategy comparison.

## Learning Objectives Alignment
Week 5 objectives 5, 6, 7, and 8.

## Estimated Time
50 to 70 minutes.

## Problem Statement
Build a small domain model such as a playlist or assignment queue that supports both default traversal and one alternate traversal strategy (for example, priority order). Then explain when this custom iterator design adds value beyond built-in collection iteration.

## Requirements
Complete the production code and tests so that:

* the domain model implements `Iterable<T>`
* `iterator()` returns the default traversal strategy
* the model exposes a second iterator strategy via a clearly named method
* both traversals operate over the same underlying data
* the program prints both traversal orders
* at least two JUnit tests verify the two traversal strategies
* one short written reflection explains when built-in iteration would have been enough

## Extension Challenge
Add a third traversal strategy such as reverse order or only-high-priority items.

## Self-Check

* Is each traversal strategy deterministic?
* Does each call return a fresh iterator with independent state?
* Did your tests assert actual sequence order values?

## Expected Output

```text
Default order: [Intro, Demo, Quiz]
Priority order: [Quiz, Demo, Intro]
```

## Run

```bash
mvn test
mvn exec:java
```

Use `mvn test` first for TDD. Tests validate insertion-order iteration, priority-order iteration, and repeated-iteration behavior.

Suggested JUnit targets:

```bash
mvn -Dtest=PlaylistTest test
```

## Rubric Focus

* Correct custom `Iterable` implementation
* Clear iterator strategy design
* Strong test coverage and explanation quality
